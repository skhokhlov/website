### Equipment

Among all computer religions I give greatest preference for Apple. In second place Linux. In general, Unix is our everything.

For edits single files I use [Atom](https://atom.io) by GitHub. For projects composed more than one file, I prefer to use powerful IDE like WebStorm и&nbsp;Xcode. Sometimes play with VIM.

I like clouds and actively work with it.

For mathematical problems I use Wolfram.
